### Thought Leadership
**Why Traditional Property Valuation Methods Are Failing Investors in Seattle's Dynamic Market**

The Seattle real estate market has changed dramatically over the past decade, yet many investors still rely on outdated methods to evaluate properties.

At Pellego Seattle, we've analyzed over 10,000 transactions and found that:

1. Traditional cap rate calculations often underestimate operating expenses by 15-20% in older Seattle properties
2. Appreciation projections based on historical city-wide data fail to capture micro-market trends
3. Rental income estimates that don't account for seasonal fluctuations can be off by up to 8%

Our latest white paper explores these challenges and introduces our neighborhood-specific valuation model that's helping investors make more accurate projections.
