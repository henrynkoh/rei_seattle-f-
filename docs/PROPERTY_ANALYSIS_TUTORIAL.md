## Pro Tips for Property Analysis

1. **Always verify rental income assumptions** by checking multiple sources, including:
   - Pellego Seattle rental comps
   - Zillow Rent Zestimate
   - Local property management companies
   - Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace listings

2. **Be conservative with expense estimates**, especially for:
   - Maintenance (use 1% of property value annually as a minimum)
   - CapEx reserves (set aside at least 5% of rental income)
   - Vacancy (use 5-8% even in hot rental markets)

3. **Consider seasonal factors** when estimating days on market and rental rates:
   - Seattle area rentals typically lease faster and at higher rates during summer months
   - Winter listings may require longer vacancy assumptions

4. **Don't ignore future infrastructure developments** that could impact property values:
   - Light rail expansions
   - Commercial developments
   - Road improvements
   - School construction or improvements

5. **Review property tax history** to anticipate potential increases:
   - Recent sale may trigger reassessment
   - Renovation permits can lead to higher assessments
   - King County typically reassesses properties annually
